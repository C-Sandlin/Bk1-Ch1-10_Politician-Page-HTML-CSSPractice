                <p>Cooper’s track record shows liberal views on the environment, immigration, civil rights, women’s rights and gay rights. And after the Newtown, Conn., massacre in December 2012, he and Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Memphis, were the only Tennessee members willing to look at tighter gun control laws. But he mixes all that with a hawkish determination to do something about the nation’s deficit spending and keep its military No. 1.</p>
                <p>But it is Cooper’s attention to budget issues, both the broad and the microscopic, that fuel his wonkish reputation. “If you don’t have a good budget, you don’t have an ability to solve any problem,” Cooper said. In 2012, he won praise from editorial writers for leading the “Brave 38,” a group of 38 House members who voted for a budget mixing tax increases with cuts in entitlement programs to square the nation’s finances. It was based on ideas from the 2010 National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform.</p>
